A python application that restricts entry into websites with in a certain period of time, part of a day.(working hours)
.
Simplified Logic:
"Checks if each website is in the content and writes to the file only if necessary."

Libraries used in this application are time and datetime for getting the current time of the day and also to give a delay in responding. The coding part is very simple
(r+ is used in python for reading and writing the file)
